Data Leakage Detector

The Data Leakage Detector is a Python script designed to track and detect data leakages in a document. The script works by adding a hidden watermark to the document each time it is accessed, allowing the administrator to identify who accessed the document if a data leak occurs. The watermark is not visible to the user and can only be detected using a specific decoding algorithm. The project is a simple step towards improving document security and can be customized to suit individual needs.
